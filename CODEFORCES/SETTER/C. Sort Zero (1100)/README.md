<h3>Easy</h3>

<div><p>
  You are given an array of n positive integers a1,a2,…,an.

In one operation you do the following:

Choose any integer x.
For all i such that ai=x, do ai:=0 (assign 0 to ai).
Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Output
For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
